**Objective**  

With this coursework, we aim to use LiDAR images of several neighborhoods in London, UK and try to predict the deprivation indices of those localities based on these images. The deprivation indices are:  
• Income: Measures the proportion of the population experiencing deprivation relating to low income  
• Employment: Measures the proportion of the working-age population in an area involuntarily excluded from the labour market  
• Education: Measures the lack of attainment and skills in the local population  
• Health: Measures the risk of premature death and the impairment of quality of life through poor physical or mental health  
• Crime: Measures the risk of personal and material victimization at the local level  
• Barriers to Housing: Measures the physical and financial accessibility of housing and local services  
• Living Environment: Measures the quality of both the indoor and outdoor local environment    

**Approach**  

We have been provided with two sets of data  
1. A dataset (csv format) that contains the geographic details of the neighborhoods  
2. The corresponding LiDAR images of each of these neighborhoods   

We will examine a couple of Deep Learning Models, viz, VGG16 and Renet50v2 to understand how well these images can predict deprivation indices. The index we will be exploring is ‘Living Environment’.
